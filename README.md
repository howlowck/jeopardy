### Dev Troubleshooting

* Errors in the `tsconfig.json` file or other TS related issues: This might be because you are not using right version of TypeScript. Navigate to a `.ts` file, and on the lower-right corner you'll see the Typescript version. Click on the version, and choose "Select Typescript Version" > "Workspace Version". This will set the typescript version for your VS Code language server.
